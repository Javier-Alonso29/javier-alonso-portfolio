        As part of a multidisciplinary team composed of 20 developers, 5 QA engineers, 1 Scrum Master, 2 Product Owners, and 2 UI/UX designers, I worked on the development, maintenance, and support of products within the Atlassian ecosystem, which were distributed through the Atlassian Marketplace. Our agile team operated under Scrum methodologies, managing tasks through Jira and ensuring an efficient workflow from planning to deployment.  
      </p>

      <p>
        My role as a Full Stack Developer Junior covered both frontend and backend development. On the frontend, I designed and optimized user interfaces using AngularJS and React, ensuring a seamless experience for our customers. On the backend, I worked with Spring Boot and Express.js, implementing and maintaining key endpoints for application functionality. Additionally, I performed migrations and optimizations in databases such as Oracle, MySQL, and MariaDB, ensuring data integrity and performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges within the team was achieving the Atlassian Marketplace Partner certification, which required strict adherence to quality standards and best development practices. As part of this process, we conducted annual performance evaluations to optimize our products and ensure compliance with Atlassian’s requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the different products we managed, my primary assignment was Agile Retrospectives for Jira, a tool designed to help teams organize and conduct retrospective sessions within the Atlassian environment. These live sessions allowed participants to submit ideas, discuss improvements, and generate Action Items, which could be converted into Jira tickets within the client’s workspace.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the most significant features I worked on was a request from Dell, one of our most important clients. This feature enabled the creation and reuse of retrospective templates, eliminating the need to manually configure each session. This improvement streamlined the process and enhanced the user experience, making it easier for large teams to adopt the tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to my development responsibilities, I also participated in the release and deployment process for applications in the Atlassian Marketplace, ensuring that each release met quality and compatibility requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working in this environment allowed me to deepen my knowledge of best development practices, agile methodologies, and software optimization, while collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver scalable and high-impact solutions.
