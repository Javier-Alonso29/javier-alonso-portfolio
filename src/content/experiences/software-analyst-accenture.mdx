      At Accenture, I played a key role in the development of a strategic application designed to drive technological innovation for a major banking institution. This application serves as an interactive replica of the bank’s mobile app, enabling users to explore its features through guided tutorials and demonstrations.
    </p>

      <p>
        The platform was developed using internal banking technologies, along with pure JavaScript and Web Components, ensuring a modular and scalable architecture. Our development process followed the Scrum methodology, delivering iterative releases that allowed the client to track progress and see continuous improvements in the application.
    </p>

      <p>
        One of the most significant and challenging phases of the project was the rebranding of the entire application. This involved a complete redesign, applying new brand colors, typography, and UI elements, ensuring alignment with the bank’s updated brand identity. The rebranding process required a meticulous approach to ensure consistency and a seamless transition across all components of the application.
        </p>

      <p>
       Through this experience, I gained deeper expertise in Web Components development, UI/UX implementation, and agile software development, contributing to an application that enhances user engagement and digital adoption within the banking sector.
