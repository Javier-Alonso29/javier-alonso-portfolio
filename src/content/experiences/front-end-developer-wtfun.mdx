    The main goal of the project was to migrate the existing landing page — originally built using GoDaddy + Marketing — to a fully custom, tailor-made solution, while implementing a visual update aligned with the client’s corporate brand guidelines.

        This project was developed for WTFUN Studio, a company focused on creating digital and cinematic products. The client previously had a landing page built using GoDaddy + Marketing, which presented multiple limitations due to the platform’s low customization capability.
      </p>

      <p>
        The development of the new landing page allowed the client to communicate visually and functionally what the previous tool did not. Several sections were implemented: on the Home page, we integrated an animation provided by the client, synchronized with custom-developed typographic effects, as well as the full display of their demo reel.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the Contact section, we implemented a lead-capture form, with submissions handled through EmailJS, leveraging its API to send customized emails directly to the studio’s corporate mailbox.
      </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, we developed the Work section, designed to interactively showcase the range of services offered by the company. These are displayed in a vertical list with lower-cut animation effects on each title, accompanied by representative images and videos provided by WTFUN Studio.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project marked an important milestone in my professional career, as it pushed me to rethink my development process. In previous projects, my main focus had been to deliver functional solutions through my products, without prioritizing visual communication. In this case, the primary goal was to achieve a visually attractive experience aligned with the brand identity, which led me to approach development differently — paying close attention to style, color palette, and typography in order to effectively highlight WTFUN Studio’s work and expertise in an aesthetic and compelling way.
