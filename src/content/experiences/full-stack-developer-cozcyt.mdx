        My involvement began from the earliest stages of software development, starting with requirements gathering. During this phase, we implemented various information-gathering techniques, such as interviews and direct observation of key stakeholders, which allowed us to gain a clear and accurate understanding of the client's needs and expectations. This detailed analysis enabled us to create a solid proposal, which was reviewed and ultimately approved by the client.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the proposal was validated, we moved on to the design phase. Using tools like Figma, we began to create user interfaces, which provided us with a concrete vision of the final user experience and ensured that we were aligned with the client's expectations. This process was crucial in ensuring that the designed solutions were both functional and intuitive.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the design approved, we began developing the product using the technologies and tools previously selected. During this phase, development was carried out iteratively, allowing us to release software versions at regular intervals for testing and adjustments based on client feedback and emerging needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The process culminated in the final version of the application, which was designed to have a significant impact, as the application would be responsible for managing the scholarship award process for students at various educational levels. Due to the nature of the system, we had to ensure that the application could handle a high volume of users on a critical day when the winner of the award had to be determined. This final phase required special attention to system performance and scalability to ensure a smooth experience for all involved users.
