        In this role, I was responsible for analyzing an existing web application and leading its migration to modern technologies. The original application was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask, and I successfully migrated it to React, improving maintainability, performance, and user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary goal of this application was to manage and visualize statistical data stored in datasets. It featured interactive charts and data tables, allowing users to filter and manipulate information dynamically. Additionally, the application enabled users to generate Excel reports based on their filtered datasets, ensuring efficient data export.
    </p>

    <p>
    One of the key challenges of the project was handling Excel file processing. The system needed to transform raw dataset information into structured Excel files following predefined formats established by the organization. The application also integrated an SDMX-compliant data dictionary, ensuring standardized exchange of statistical data and metadata.
    </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore, the platform supported user authentication and allowed users to create customized statistical queries across various countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The ability to filter and process large datasets efficiently was a crucial aspect of the project, requiring robust performance optimizations to deliver a seamless user experience.
