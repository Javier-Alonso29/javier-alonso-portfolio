## The Tools Every Web Developer Should Use in Their Daily Workflow (2025 Stack)

As a software engineer, I spend a large part of my day using tools that not only allow me to write code, but also help me stay organized, optimize time, and work collaboratively. Over time, I have tried many different options, but only a few have become essential in my daily workflow.

In this article, I want to share **the tools I use as a web developer**, as well as others I have discovered through colleagues’ recommendations or simple curiosity. If you are just starting out in the world of development or want to optimize your current stack, this blog can serve as a useful reference.

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code is, without a doubt, one of the most widely used code editors in the world. Its popularity is due to the fact that it is lightweight, fast, free, and extremely powerful.

It allows you to easily create, modify, delete, and view files. In addition, its extension system makes it a fully customizable tool: you can add snippets, themes, icons, and integrations with Git, Docker, linters, and many other options.

If you are learning how to program, VS Code is one of the best choices to get started. Its installation is simple on both Windows and macOS.

### Windsurf (AI for Development)

Windsurf is a code editor that integrates artificial intelligence agents capable of helping you build features, fix bugs, or even understand complete projects.

The workflow is simple: you send a request and, since it has access to your project, it can analyze it, understand it, and propose a solution. These types of tools are part of the new approach known as *vibe coding*, where AI becomes a development copilot.

### Warp (Modern Terminal with AI)

Warp is a modern terminal that allows you to work with multiple tabs and processes at the same time. Its interface is much more user-friendly than traditional terminals.

Additionally, it includes an artificial intelligence assistant that helps you understand errors, improve commands, and speed up repetitive tasks.

### Git (Version Control)

Git is an indispensable tool for any developer. It allows you to track changes in your code, work with branches, undo mistakes, and collaborate with other developers without conflicts.

Knowing at least the basic commands such as `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull` is essential for anyone in the software world.

### Postman (API Testing)

Postman is ideal for visually testing endpoints. It allows you to inspect the server response, headers, parameters, body, and all the data involved in a request to a REST API.

It is an essential tool for both backend and frontend developers.

### NVM (Node Version Manager)

NVM allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on the same machine. This helps avoid many compatibility issues between projects.

You can easily install, switch, and manage Node versions according to the requirements of each application.

### TablePlus (Database Management)

TablePlus is a tool that allows you to connect to and manage different database engines from a single interface.

It is ideal for visualizing information, running SQL queries, filtering data, and managing database structures in a simple and visual way.

### MongoDB Compass

If you work with MongoDB, this tool is practically mandatory. MongoDB Compass allows you to explore, manage, and query your databases without using the console.

It is intuitive, fast, and perfect for visual analysis of NoSQL data.

### Notion (Productivity and Second Brain)

Notion has become my operations center: here I organize my projects, take notes, store technical documentation, commands, workflows, and in fact, I also write this blog here.

It is a versatile tool that adapts both to individual developers and full teams.

### Conclusion

These are some of the tools I use daily as a web developer. Whether for professional projects or personal ones, all of them help me maintain a more agile, organized, and efficient workflow.

If you are building your own development stack, I hope some of these tools will be useful to you.
