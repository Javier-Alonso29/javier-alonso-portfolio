Git tags are immutable references that point to specific points in a repository's history. They are primarily used to mark important project versions, such as software releases (e.g., v1.0.0, v2.0.0), making it easier to identify key milestones in development. Their use helps maintain a clear and structured version history of the software, helping teams track significant changes and facilitate deployment management.

## Why Use Git Tags?
There are many reasons to use tags in Git, but the most common ones are:

- Mark official releases
- Allow reverting to previous versions without needing to remember commit hashes
- Facilitate identification of key development milestones

## Types of Tags

### Lightweight Tags
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```
Lightweight tags are merely aliases for a specific commit. They don't have associated metadata (name, email, and date) and cannot be digitally signed. Therefore, they are not recommended for use in production environments.

### Annotated Tags
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First stable version"
```
Annotated tags in Git are a type of tag that stores additional information about a specific commit. Unlike lightweight tags, annotated tags include:

<div class="flex flex-col">
<p class="my-0">✅ Tag author</p>
<p class="my-0">✅ Creation date</p>
<p class="my-0">✅ Descriptive message (similar to a commit)</p>
<p class="my-0">✅ Digital signature (optional, for authentication)</p>
</div>

## How to View Your Created Tags?

You can view all your created tags with this command:

```bash
git tag
v1.0
v2.0
```

## Versioning Conventions

Proper software versioning is essential for maintaining clear control of the different stages and changes in a project. One of the most popular methodologies for managing versions is Semantic Versioning or SemVer.

The semantic versioning format is as follows:

```
v1.0.0
│ │ │
│ │ └─ PATCH: Bug fixes
│ └─── MINOR: New features
└───── MAJOR: Breaking changes
```

### Usage Examples

Here are 3 examples of annotated tags for different types of versions:

```bash
# Tagging a major version
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Breaking changes: new API"

# Tagging a minor version
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Added new advanced search feature"

# Tagging a patch
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Fixed login module bug"
```

## Essential Commands

```bash
# List tags
git tag

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"

# Push tags
git push origin v1.0.0

# Push all tags
git push origin --tags

# Delete tag
git tag -d v1.0.0
```

## Best Practices
<div class="flex flex-col">
<p class="my-0">✅ **Use annotated tags** for releases</p>
<p class="my-0">✅ **Follow SemVer** for numbering</p>
<p class="my-0">✅ **Include descriptive messages**</p>
<p class="my-0">✅ **Don't modify published tags**</p>
<p class="my-0">✅ **Document important changes**</p>
</div>

## Conclusion

Tags are a best practice for software development as they allow us to maintain a clear and well-structured history of our application versions. Additionally, they help us more easily identify key milestones we've achieved in each version.

Remember that software development isn't just about creating software, but also about managing the tools we use to create it.

Therefore, having a clearer and more professional management of our work makes it easier for us to perform our tasks effectively.
